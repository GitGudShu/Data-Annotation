# Data-Annotation
This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art web platform for visualizing preloaded images from an existing dataset, analyzing segmented objects (pedestrians, vehicles, urban infrastructure), and assigning priority levels based on their importance in urban driving (e.g., a crossing pedestrian is prioritized over a parked vehicle).
